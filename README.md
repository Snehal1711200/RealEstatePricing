# RealEstatePricing

The importance of a Real Estate Machine Learning (ML) project for pricing lies in its ability to provide accurate, data-driven insights for property valuation.  ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of historical data, including property features (size, location, condition), market trends, economic indicators.ML can segment the market by understanding customer preferences and needs, helping to price properties according to specific buyer or tenant profiles. It can also predict the optimal price range for specific buyer categories.

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict Real estate prices based on various specifications such as Square_Feet, Number of Bedrooms, Num_Bathrooms, Year_Built,
       Distance_to_Center and other features using Machine Learning models.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about various properties , their specifications, and their respective prices.

Features include:

Num_Floors

Has_Garden

Has_Pool

Garage_Size

Location_Score

Distance_to_Center

Size (sq ft)

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms

Year Built

Price (Target Variable)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)

Streamlit (For Web Deployment)

📌 Steps Involved

Data Collection & Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

Model Selection & Training:

Linear Regression

Evaluation: Using RMSE, MSE, R², and MAE to measure accuracy.

Deployment: Creating a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

📈 Results & Insights

The Linear Regression model achieved the highest accuracy with an R² score of 97.27.

Feature importance analysis showed that size(Square Feet) and	Number of Bedrooms are key price predictors.

🎯 Future Scope

Expand the dataset with more real estate properties.

Improve model accuracy using deep learning techniques.

Deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions.
